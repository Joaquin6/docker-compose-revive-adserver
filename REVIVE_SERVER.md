# Revive Server

## How Revive Adserver Works

Use the Revive Adserver interface to:

* Manage the [advertisers](https://documentation.revive-adserver.com/display/DOCS/Advertisers) that will be displaying advertisements on your website (or the website or websites that you manage advertising for).
* Manage the [campaigns](https://documentation.revive-adserver.com/display/DOCS/Campaigns), banners and trackers for those advertisers.
* Manage the [website or websites](https://documentation.revive-adserver.com/display/DOCS/Websites) that you will be displaying advertisements on via Revive Adserver.
* Manage the [zones](https://documentation.revive-adserver.com/display/DOCS/Zones) for those websites, and generate invocation tags to place into websites to display banners.
